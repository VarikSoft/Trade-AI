# AI Stock Trading Bot
This repository contains my main project for the upcoming year — the development of a fully autonomous AI-based stock trading system.
My goal is to build a bot that can intelligently analyze and operate on the stock market with minimal manual intervention. By combining strategic logic with machine learning techniques, I aim to create a system capable of making consistent and profitable decisions over time.

While the journey will be complex and iterative, the target is clear:

### Achieve at least 70% profit over the course of the bot’s active trading period.

This is an ongoing and evolving project. Everything here will reflect my experiments, progress, research, and attempts to reach true AI-powered investment performance.
